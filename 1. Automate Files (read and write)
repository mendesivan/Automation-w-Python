#reading files

#for the below example create a plain text input file to utilize as part of the read function.
#if using Jupyter Notebook, upload file or change your directory to read from your PC.
#note: since the file is uploaded to Jupyter Notebook, I can just call it rather than providing 
#a system path. (see 'inputfile.txt', and not 'C:Path\Location\File\etc....')

f = open('inputfile.txt','r') #open file
passFile = open('passFile.txt','w') #'P' files #write
failFile = open('failFile.txt','w') #'F' files #write
for line in f:  #iterate
    line_split = line.split() 
    if line_split[2] == 'P':
        passFile.write(line)
    else:
        failFile.write(line)
f.close() #close file after reading it.
passFile.close()
failFile.close()
